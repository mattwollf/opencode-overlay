		OpenCode is an AI-powered coding agent designed specifically for terminal-based development workflows. 
		Built by the creators of SST, it provides intelligent code assistance, completion, and generation 
		capabilities directly in your terminal environment.

		Key features:
		- AI-powered code generation and completion
		- Terminal-based user interface (TUI)
		- Support for multiple AI providers (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
		- Client/server architecture for flexible deployment
		- Integration with popular development tools (fzf, ripgrep)
		- Provider-agnostic design for maximum compatibility

		OpenCode combines the power of modern language models with a native terminal experience, 
		making it ideal for developers who prefer command-line workflows. Unlike web-based alternatives, 
		OpenCode runs entirely on your machine and can work with local or remote AI providers.
